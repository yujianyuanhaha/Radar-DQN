# Overview
The work replaces the mdp solver in Ersin work as dqn(deep q network) solver. The codes are mostly written in .m except for the ```dqn.py``` file.  
It is NOT preferable to run codes in this blended way due to the low efficient computation and difficult to adjust the parameters within the dqn solver. Moreover, these codes may bring the new compatible problem when moving to ARC platform.


# Setup
1. version: matlab 2018a, python 2.7, tensorflow 1.6.0
2. add in python & tensorflow into matlab path:  
in matlab terminal 
``` 
py.sys.path
insert(py.sys.path,int32(0),'/PATH_of_Tensorflow')
```  
the ```PATH_of_Tensorflow``` depend on where you install them, e.g. in my mac OS, they look like
```
insert(py.sys.path,int32(0),'/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/')
insert(py.sys.path,int32(0),'/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages')
```
after that, type in
```
py.importlib.import_module('dqn')
```
it will work if no error pop up.  







# How to run
For Mac OS  
refer to setup step 1-2
1. start matlab from terminal(by the [guide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45733111/importing-tensorflow-in-matlab-via-python-interface)) from the PATH where /bin of Matlab is, in my Mac OS, it is like change to path ```/Application/MATLAB_R2018a.app/bin```
2. after Matlab launch, change path to where ```dqn.py``` file is locate, type in 
    ```
    py.importlib.import_module('dqn')
    ``` 
to load the python module.  
3. execute ```RunSimulations.m``` file, notice replace the 'dqn' as 'mdp' solver(last second option) recurrent to Ersin mdp settings.

---
For Ubuntu (Matlab version 2018a) User
refer to setup step 1-2 as well, and then follow below  
1. downgrade tensorflow to version 1.5.0 to avoid kernel dead error in ubuntu, in terminal  
    ```
    conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow=1.5.0
    ```
2. replace(actually work as update) the ```libstdc++.so.6```,```libstdc++.so.6.0.22``` of matlab as the those ```libstdc++.so.6```,```libstdc++.so.6.0.22``` of anaconda.  
in terminal, type in command as below. The second command just archived the old lib, and third copy the new one from anaconda, similiar to the other lib.   
    ```
    cd /usr/local/MATLAB/R2018a/sys/os/glnxa64/
    sudo mv libstdc++.so.6 libstdc++.so.6.old
    sudo cp ~/anaconda2/lib/libstdc++.so.6 .
    sudo mv libstdc++.so.6.0.22 libstdc++.so.6.0.22.old
    sudo cp ~/anaconda2/lib/libstdc++.so.6.24 .
    ```

3. start matlab from terminal(same as Mac OS step 1)  
4. after Matlab launch, change path to where ```dqn.py``` file is locate(same as Mac OS step 2)
5. in Matlab, type in command
    ```
    py.sys.setdlopenflags(int32(10))
    ```
6. load the python module (same as Mac OS step 2)
7. execute ```RunSimulations.m``` file


After the first setup pass, next time we start the matlab from terminal, go by  
1. change directory to where ```dqn.py```  is  
2. for ubuntu in matlab type in  ```py.sys.setdlopenflags(int32(10))```, for Mac OS skip this step  
2. then in matlab type in  ``` py.importlib.import_module('dqn')```
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Notice
1. restart Matlab and reload .py file each time when editing the ```dqn.py``` file.
2. restart Matlab and reload .py file each time when NumBand changes.(the tensorflow REUSE bugs to be solved later)
3. apply ```int32()``` when pass value from .m to .py
4. apply ```np.array()``` when receive array value from .m to .py
5. [PyException](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/170466-python-from-2014b-matlab-debug-challanges-where-is-python-stdout-stderr) with try-catch sentence may provide inner information of bugs during debugging.

# News
1. 7/17 the codes running through.


# Bugs üêû
1. unmatch of ```State``` and ```NumBands```, i.e. the NumBands in 5 in the default case, while the State is 1 times 4 vector instead of 1 times 5.
2. the ```CurrentActionNumber``` outrange, probably comes from the first one, I just did roll over.
